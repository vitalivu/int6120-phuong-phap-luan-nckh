What I learnt:
===

- MikTex as a repository and package management
- Manually install packages
- TexMaker as the IDE
    - Quick build option, with bib
- Setup the template for document
    - overleaf
- Create a LaTex document:
    - indexing, without indexing headers
    - math symbols
    - include images
    - draw tables
    - format the document
    - include bib:
        - debug bib file with online tool, TexMaker is not good with debug bib file
    - page setup:
        - adding line numbers
        - setup footer and header
